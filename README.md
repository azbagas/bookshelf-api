# Dicoding Final Project: Bookshelf API

This is a final project from Dicoding in the class "Belajar Membuat Aplikasi Back-End untuk Pemula." In this project, I built a RESTful API for managing books using Node.js with the [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) framework. Without a database, the book data is stored in memory. So, when the app stops, all the data will be erased.

To run this project, simply do the following commands:
```bash
npm install

# Using basic node
npm run start

# or using nodemon
npm run start-dev
```
